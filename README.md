# Artemis and Hermes Boon Additions/Overhaul
Ever felt like Artemis was a bit useless? Wanted to see her drop as a regular god? This mod adds in 4 of Artemis' Hades 1 boons, and allows her to spawn like a regular god, alongside adding some boons to Hermes to expand his arsenal<br>

You are able to optionally enable the Critical Hit Scaling through ImGUI or config file, and it also works along side my other mod [Generalist](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/zannc/Generalist/)
